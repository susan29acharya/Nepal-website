                        <p>
                            Nepal's history dates back to ancient times,
                            beginning with the Kiranti people as early rulers.
                            The Licchavis ruled from the 4th to 8th centuries,
                            followed by the Malla dynasty, which fostered art
                            and culture. In the 18th century, King Prithvi
                            Narayan Shah unified Nepal into a single kingdom. It
                            remained independent and was never colonized,
                            serving as a buffer between British India and China.
                            After a civil war in the 1990s, Nepal transitioned
                            from a monarchy to a federal democratic republic in
                            2008, ending its centuries-old monarchy.

                            Nepal,[b] is a landlocked country in South Asia. It

                            mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes
                            parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It borders the

                            Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India

                            from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has
                            a
                            diverse geography, including fertile plains,
                            subalpine
                            forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest
                            mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest
                            point on
                            Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the
                            largest
                            city. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual,
                            multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with
                            Nepali as
                            the official language.<br>.<br>

                            The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the
                            Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era in
                            ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the
                            predominant
                            religion of the country. In the middle of the first
                            millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of
                            Buddhism,
                            was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of
                            northern
                            Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet.
                            The
                            centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined
                            with
                            the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the
                            prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala.
                            The
                            Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was
                            dominated
                            by the valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region
                            developed distinct traditional art and architecture.
                            By
                            the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the
                            unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established
                            the
                            Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with
                            the
                            British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers.
                            The
                            country was never colonised but served as a buffer
                            state
                            between Imperial China and British India.
                            Parliamentary
                            democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice
                            suspended
                            by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese
                            Civil War in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in
                            the
                            establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending
                            the
                            world's last Hindu monarchy.

                    <p>Records mention the Gopalas and Mahishapalas believed to
                        have been the earliest rulers with their capital at
                        Matatirtha, the south-west corner of the Kathmandu
                        Valley. From the 7th or 8th Century B.C. the Kirantis
                        are said to have ruled the valley. Their famous King
                        Yalumber is even mentioned in the epic, ‘Mahabharat’.
                        Around 300 A.D. the Lichhavis arrived from northern
                        India and overthrew the Kirantis. One of the legacies of
                        the Lichhavis is the Changu Narayan Temple near
                        Bhaktapur, a UNESCO World Heritage Site (Culture), which
                        dates back to the 5th Century. In the early 7th Century,
                        Amshuvarma, the first Thakuri king took over the throne
                        from his father-in-law who was a Lichhavi. He married
                        off his daughter Bhrikuti to the famous Tibetan King
                        Tsong Tsen Gampo thus establishing good relations with
                        Tibet. The Lichhavis brought art and architecture to the
                        valley but the golden age of creativity arrived in 1200
                        A.D with the Mallas.<br><br>

                        During their 550 year rule, the Mallas built numerous
                        temples and splendid palaces with picturesque squares.
                        It was also during their rule that society and the
                        cities became well organized; religious festivals were
                        introduced and literature, music and art were
                        encouraged. After the death of Yaksha Malla, the valley
                        was divided into three kingdoms: Kathmandu (Kantipur),
                        Bhaktapur (Bhadgaon) and Patan (Lalitpur). Around this
                        time, the Nepal as we know it today was divided into
                        about 46 independent principalities. One among these was
                        the kingdom of Gorkha with a Shah ruler. Much of
                        Kathmandu Valley’s history around this time was recorded
                        by Capuchin friars who lived in the valley on their way
                        in and out of Tibet.<br><br></p>

                    <p>Nepal,[a] officially the Federal Democratic Republic of
                        Nepal,[b] is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is
                        mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes
                        parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It borders the Tibet
                        Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India to
                        the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly
                        separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and
                        from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a
                        diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine
                        forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest
                        mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on
                        Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest
                        city. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual,
                        multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as
                        the official language.<br>.<br>

                        The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the
                        Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era in
                        ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant
                        religion of the country. In the middle of the first
                        millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism,
                        was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern
                        Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet. The
                        centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with
                        the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the
                        prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The
                        Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated
                        by the valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region
                        developed distinct traditional art and architecture. By
                        the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the
                        unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established the
                        Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the
                        British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. The
                        country was never colonised but served as a buffer state
                        between Imperial China and British India. Parliamentary
                        democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended
                        by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese
                        Civil War in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the
                        establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the
                        world's last Hindu monarchy.
